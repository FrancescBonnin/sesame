Sesame is a Python3 package for solving the drift diffusion Poisson equations for multi-dimensional systems using finite differences.

The software computes the steady state of a semiconductor between two contacts, and subject to voltage bias and/or illumination. It was developed to study polycrystalline solar cells containing charged interfaces (grain boundaries, sample surface). Sesame handles single charged states and continuum of defect states alike.

Sesame includes modules that can be used in Python code as well as a standalone GUI.  Example scripts and GUI input files can be found in the examples directory.

Support for this project comes from the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology and the University of Maryland.
